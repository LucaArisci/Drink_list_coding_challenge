# Drink list coding challenge

This is a coding challenge to test basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills. You can view the starting point of the challenge at:

https://lucaarisci.github.io/Drink_list_coding_challenge/starter

and the final result at:

https://lucaarisci.github.io/Drink_list_coding_challenge/final

## TEST

- **Just `index.js` and `styles.css`** files should be modified
- You can leave **comments** in your code in order to better understand your intentions.
- You are evaluated on your **problem solving skills**, not only on your results.
- App is supposed to be run on modern browser, so you can use modern js, css, html **no compatibility concerns!**
- You cannot import/use any library: **just plain js**!
- You can **use any manual and/or online resource** but we strongly suggest to try to **solve it by yourself**.

## Assignments

As you can see our drink list is incomplete in styling and features.

You are left with 3 assignments to complete it:

### 1. Sorting

Implement drink list sorting in ASCENDING order by `price` first, then by `name`: this means that when 2 drinks have the same price, (i.e: "Old Fashioned" and "Bloody Mary" have the same price, so "Bloody Mary" should precede "Old Fashioned").

### 2. Styling

Style the drink list in order to be as similar as possible to `final.png` using flexbox.
You can target DOM elements using classes and tag names already inferred in the HTML template you can find in `index.js` (please do not update it!).

### 3. Interaction

Add a button to reverse the sorting: every time the user clicks on it the sorting should be updated from ASCENDING to DESCENDING order and vice-versa.
